# Ansible Hubot

> **NOTE**: 1.3.0 default change: This role now defaults to installing a
> Slack based hubot with the `hubot_adapter` variable. Changing the variable
> value to 'hipchat' will install for HipChat instead.

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) role for
[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/), the wonderful chatting robot that is sure
to bring your team much delight and various values of increased productivity
throughout the livelong day!

By default this Hubot is configured for Slack, but that can be easily
changed work with HipChat by editing `vars/main.yml`, updating the value of
*hubot_adapter*, and adding the appropriate environment variables to
`templates/_hubot_{{hubot_adapter}}.env.j2`.

## Requirements

This Hubot role requires a Ubuntu or CentOS based Linux host and has been
tested to function on Ubuntu and CentOS with the following specific
software versions:

* Ansible: 1.9.2
* Hubot: GitHub Master
* Node.js: 0.10.37
* CentOS: 6
* Ubuntu: 14.04, 13.10, 13.04, 12.10, 12.04

## Works with Ansible Galaxy

This role is designed to be installed via the `ansible-galaxy` command
instead of being directly run from the git repository.

You should install it like this:

```
ansible-galaxy install brianshumate.hubot
```

You'll want to make sure you have write access to `/etc/ansible/roles/` since
that is where the role will be installed by default, or define your own
Ansible role path by creating a `$HOME/.ansible.cfg` file with these contents:

```
[defaults]
roles_path = <path_to_your_preferred_role_location>
```

Change `<path_to_your_preferred_role_location>` to a directory you have write
access to.

See the [ansible-galaxy](http://docs.ansible.com/galaxy.html) documentation
for more details.

to make use of these scripts and add your own.

If you add more custom scripts be sure to add any Node.js dependencies
required by the scripts to the `hubot_node_packages` variable list as well.

## Configuration

Edit the variables defined in the following files as necessary:

* `defaults/main.yml`
* `vars/main.yml`

Then, copy the necessary `templates/hubot_?.env.j2` to 
`templates/_hubot_?.env.j2` where *?* is your hubot_adapter value, and update
as necessary with the particular environment variables you need 
for your Hubot instance.

Copy `hosts.example` to `hosts` and edit it to update the values for your
Hubot host. Be sure to change the following values:

* `0.0.0.0`
* `ubuntu`
* `~/.ssh/hubot_id`

Finally, update the `site.yml` playbook if you plan to use it and set
`hubot_identity` to the short username of your bot.

## Example Playbook

After configuration a basic Hubot installation and activation is possible
using the included `site.yml` playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

You can also pass variables in using the `--extra-vars` option
to the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --extra-vars "hubot_admin=penelope hubot_adapter=hipchat hubot_identity=penelope hubot_owner='Penelope <penelope@example.com>' hubot_description='A stunning mermaid bot'"
```
